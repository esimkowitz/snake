# snake
This is my take on the game Snake. I made this for fun while taking Computer Science 1. Some of these 
files are part of the Sedgwick API, which we utilized in the course. All of the code was built in 
Eclipse. The code I wrote is in the snake folder. The rest is supporting material. Within the snake 
folder, there are two "control" files; one utilizes an interface to run the code (this one is less 
refined because it was an afterthought), the other control file is more finalized and does not utilize 
an interface. Both controls utilize the same basic objects, which is why some have unused methods, 
depending on which control you're using. There are also just some additional methods I thought may be 
helpful for debugging or just in case I wanted to change anything down the road. I do not own the 
Sedgwick API, as far as I can tell it is the intellectual copyright of Robert Sedgewick and Kevin 
Wayne, though I do not know what licenses they have on it. I've emailed the authors of the book that 
the API was a component of and I'll update this repository when I've heard back.
